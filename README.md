# Ray Hong — Junior Software Developer Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** and deployed via **GitHub Pages**.

The portfolio serves as a central hub for my projects, technical skills, and background as I transition from IT support into software development.
